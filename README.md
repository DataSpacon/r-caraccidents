### Road Accidents database mining by classification and clustering in R 

<p1>An accident happens when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal or road debris, or other stationary obstruction, such as a tree, pole or building. The accidents often result in injury, death, and property damage. The main cause of accidents are due to human behaviours such us over speeding, drunken driving distractions to driver, red light jumping, avoiding safety gears like seat belts and helmets, non-adherence to lane driving and overtaking in a wrong manner.
There are also other factors related to Roads that contribute in the accidents:
Pedestrians - carelessness, crossing at wrong places, moving on carriageway.
Passengers - projecting their body outside vehicle, talking to drivers, alighting and boarding vehicle from wrong side, travelling on footboards, catching a running bus,
Vehicles - failure of brakes or steering, tyre burst, insufficient headlights, overloading, projecting loads outside of the loading area.
Road Conditions - potholes, damaged road, eroded road merging of rural roads with highways, diversions, illegal speed breakers.
Weather conditions - fog, snow, heavy rainfall, wind storms, hail storms.
The methods and measures in road accident data mining can refer to road traffic safety â€“ used to prevent road users from being killed or seriously injured.</p1>

In the first part of the research I am going to use supervised machine learning (decision tree and neural networks) to find whether we can classify accident factors to predict its fatality.

In the second part I will use unsupervised method (clustering) to research whether we can allocate car makes into clusters based on the accident factors. The research, if performed by insurance companies, would help in allocating cars into insurance groups. Based on the factor where was the first impact on the car, we could later classify it based on the cost of repairs.

The research was done using R studio . The hardware is with the following specification: Intel I7 920 processor,8 GB of Ram and 300 GB SSD drive.
